Overview

This project aims to provide comprehensive statistics and information about Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) events, fighters, and matchups. It involves data scraping from MMA websites to collect event details, fighter profiles, and fight results. The scraped data is then stored in a MongoDB database and served through a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.

The front end of the website is developed using React.js, providing a user-friendly interface to explore MMA statistics. Users can browse upcoming and past events, view fighter profiles, analyze fight statistics, and more. The website offers valuable insights for MMA enthusiasts, analysts, and fans.
