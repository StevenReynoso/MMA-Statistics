Todo: <Row1 setActiveId={setActiveId} />  in Row2.tsx file, 
      loads the fight events twice, one capable of loading the fights
      within that event card and one that cannot that is loaded through
      Row1.tsx file
Bug

TODO: when row is expanded names glitch out, because of speed of snapping,
      could be caused of the ease out function, not easing out how it should.

      These pictures being used for fighters for events, do not expand into a full fighter sillhouette
      and cause space issues when fight is expanded, need to switch them to these images
      blue can be switched with red to show their respective sides.

Todo: Create something to show users differences of upcoming fights
Ft    and previous fights easier than looking at dates, when looking
      at fighter cards.

Todo: TBD fighter cards dont necessarily need to be there, but ufc web
      doesnt upload the pics for their headliners right away, for the
      events, so it shows as silhouettes even though the card is active
      with all fights being shown when clicked on.
      ex (pantoja vs erceg as of 3 / 17 / 24)
Ft

Todo: when opening fights, fights expand where they are and will expand off screen,
      might be better to expand and adjust fight to show all.
